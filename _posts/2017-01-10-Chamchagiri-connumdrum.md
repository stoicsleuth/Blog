# Chamchagiri: A reprisal. (For appraisal)

It is a tragic day for the Indians, a disastrous way to start off a new year. After eradicating polio from our country, our ‘beloved’ Government now wishes to expunge Chamchagiri from India, which is supposed to be ‘logged as the greatest achievement in the history of this country since the methodical abolition of corruption.”

What a preposterous and baseless log that would be! With our utmost respect to one of the few remnant traits of Indian culture, a cult adhered with the aspirants of The Great Indian Dream, we delve deeper into the mysterious yet sophisticated career path that is Chamchagiri.

### What is Chamchagiri?

*chamcha/ˈtʃʌmtʃə/-one who practises sycophancy;*

Such a fancy word like sycophancy pales in comparison with the modest, grounded streetwise lingo ‘Chamcha’. Chamchagiri has been inherent in our ancestry, as per a NAAC (National Accreditation and Acknowledgement of Chamchas) certified historian.

“ Take a cue from Mahabharata. The 98 brothers of Duryadhona and Dusshyashona; they were all coruscating practitioner of the artistry in question. It is true that their suavity towards a flawless execution of the art had its share of blunders. Still, it proves, like aeroplane and Pythagorean theorem, Chamchagiri finds its origin here in our motherland. It’s all in ancient scriptures, written in Sanskrit.”

Another report published originally in the Times of India dictates that there has been breakthrough research to determine the abundant correlation between the genetic material of human beings and canines. Which again reiterates the claim that sycophancy is a natural and genetic feature which we should celebrate, rather than ostracise it as a blemish.

### Why Chamchas Chamchate?

Before answering the question, let me indulge you into the superior form of craftsmanship Chamchagiri has harboured through the crevices of time. Rendering the claims of it being sanctimonious, fallacious, it has fostered diversification. Likewise, traditional chamchagiri has moulded itself into involuntary or so much as compulsive chamchagiri, often catalysed by social media. What used to be anticipation of favour, has now metamorphosed into “like-anticipating-an-obligatory-like” policy, a perfect citation of the compulsive form. But suffice it to say that the invigorating and unconditional solidarity towards seniors, as exhibited by freshmen, is the inevitable new trend in chamchagiri.

### ACP, the sole salvation.

Whenever the coherence of a country has been compromised, a saviour stands out to redeem humanity (or caninity). ACP or Aam Chamcha Party was engineered with a sole motive- to inculcate the necessity of chamchagiri to sustain the predominantly veritable culture. Just when you thought the perpetual camaraderie of colleagues and seniors has seen its day, ACP emerged out of nowhere to advocate the regimented inadequacies of a chamcha-free society.

“Thank you for letting your life’s concerns out to catch some free breath”, an ACP spokesperson intervened upon Governments claims, which on a closer inspection boils down to the prime manifesto of ACP. Since the day you were welcomed into this world by a standing ovation, the seeds of chamchagiri have been planted into your brain. It only goes to show how redundant those self-prefixed hindrances clutched it from sprouting.

> Do you a feel a shudder going down your spine, when you’re blatantly refused to be accompanied by a series of taxi-drivers? Ever wondered how Jerry manages to slip alive every time, while you’re bludgeoned by your Boss? No matter where your chamcha-quotient lies, Aam Chamcha Party welcomes you.

To all the people with an irrational obsession with backbones, ‘Honestly’ might be your first name, but ‘half-witted’ is definitely your surname. Just like bribery and cronyism, chamchagiri has been acknowledged as a taboo. It’s high time to break free of the secrecy and prove that it doesn’t need to be affiliated with politics to practice this finest art of living.

A chamcha can be anyone. Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around his Boss’s shoulders to let him know that the absolute cornucopia of chamchas hasn’t ended.
